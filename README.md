# Honors Thesis
A Comparative Study of Emotional Understanding and Creativity in Humans and Generative Artificial Intelligence Systems

## **Project Overview**
This portfolio contains research for the two substudies of my honors thesis in Computer Science at Tulane University.

## **Creative Task**
The creative task analyzes how AI-generated responses compare to human-generated responses to questions that aim to assess creativity. This includes a sentiment analysis, analysis of sentence structure, and analysis of vocabulary.

## **Emotional Understanding Task**
The emotional understanding task analyzes how AI compares to the human ability to rate the valence and arousal levels of a person in an image. This substudy focuses on analyzing how different AI responses are from human responses to questions that aim to assess emotional understanding.
